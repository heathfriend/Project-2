# Project-2

 Just your basic Crud app. All 7 routes work as they are supposed to. I attempted both of my stretch goals, unfortunately one completely broke my page (authentication). My dropdown bar I was not as easy as I believed it would be. I could not get it to function as I wanted it to or other wise I was gonna add 2 extra pages but without the drop down bar it just seemed pointless without the dropdown bar functioning properly. I yet again attempted too much functionality instead of giving CSS the time it deserves and I NEED to put into it.
